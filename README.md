<h1 id="Title">All The Projects</h1>
<p>This repository holds all projects that have been abandoned due to the creators of them (Voltseon and ENLS) stopped working on them.</p>
<p>We have decided to put them all on this repository in order to both archive them along with giving anyone access to the newest versions of these projects and have our work not go to waste.</p>

<h3 id="Shattered-Light">Pokémon Shattered Light</h3>
<p>A Pokémon fangame made during a Relic Castle Game Jam, while we are quite happy with how it turned out, we felt like it could be better. The repository version of this has a bunch of added features we were working on for a future update. We never got around to finishing it.</p>
<p>The repository can be found under the "Shattered-Light" branch.</p>

<h3 id="Pivot">Pivot</h3>
<p>Pivot is an interesting project as we haven't really seen multiplayer utilized to this level in fangames before this. It was quite a challenge to get the game working, especially with the limitations and only having 9 days to complete it. We were working hard to turn it into something unique and amazing, but we missed the mark with some parts and development was challenging. The repository version has a lot of improvements but also quite a few unfinished additions. On top of that, the game strictly runs on servers so it'll only be a matter of time before those go down.</p>
<p>The repository can be found under the "Pivot" branch.</p>

<h3 id="Last-Wish">Pokémon and the Last Wish (Series)</h3>
<p>Pokémon and the Last Wish is a series of games that was once meant to become a trilogy and even receive an epilogue spin-off. However, unfortunately we never got around to finishing it. In the repository you will find the skeleton of the spin-off called Pokémon and the First Wish, as well as an unfinished update to the first game in the series and an unfinished DLC to the second part.</p>
<p>The repository can be found under the "Last-Wish" branch.</p>

<h3 id="Space-Trainers">Space Trainers</h3>
<p>This game was made in half the time of a Relic Castle Game Jam in order to test the limits of Pokémon Essentials's visuals. It's a short but sweet game with a very simple gameplay loop unlike any standard Pokémon game. The repository doesn't contain any new updates or changes but simply exists for anyone to take a peek under the hood.</p>
<p>The repository can be found under the "Space-Trainers" branch.</p>

<h3 id="Ethos">Pokémon Ethos</h3>
<p>The unfinished game "Pokémon Ethos" was once meant to become this large 'all custom assets' 8 gym fangame that would feel like an entirely new generation of game as if it were 2010 again. However, it was doomed to fail from the start as this is an impossible task for a small team in this small amount of time. This repository contains a few unfinished assets and a very small amount of new content. Development of the game after the release was slow and shut down very soon after.</p>
